<h1>The Best Three Tv Shows According to Hariom</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Tv Shows of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>
    Band of Brothers

</h3>
<p>
    I chose this show because of its authenticity and it gives you the persepective of a army soldier and the struggles they go through during wars
</p>
<h3>
    Game of Thrones
    
</h3>
<p>
    From the day of its release till the time it got finished it's been one of my favourite tv shows of all time 
</p>

<h3>
Mirzapur
   
</h3>
<p>
    Mirzapur has to be on my top three favourite  tv shows of all time because it shows audience the politics of rural india and and gangs which operate ther and the has been till now focused on  place and the and people for the throne of that place      </p>
